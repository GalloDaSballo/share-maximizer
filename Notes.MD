WHen you increase your debt and other troves get your debt due to the share math


They are being pushed towards insolvency and liquidation

For a Trove that exactly the CR == MCR
The Trove will be liquidatable after an operation due to the debt being given to it
This may also not happen tbh
But if you spam enough times, it should definitely happen

Can we rebase the math in some way?

We can add more debt to the shares without increasing the shares ^
